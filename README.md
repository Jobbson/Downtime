#  National Rail UK Ticket Data Analysis (Jan - Apr 2024)


In this project, I analyzed Productivity & downtime data for a soda bottling production line, including information on the operator, product, start & end times, and dowtime factors for each batch.

the Recommended Analysis include : What's the current line efficiency? (total time / min time), Are any operators underperforming?, What are the leading factors for downtime? and Do any operators struggle with particular types of operator error?

## Key insights:

### Current Line Efficiency

Production line is currently operating at 64% efficiency (calculated as total actual production time vs. minimum expected time).
Significant gaps between expected and actual production times suggest inefficiencies, particularly in operator handling and downtime management.

### Operator Performance:

Charlie had the longest cumulative downtime at 228 minutes, primarily due to machine adjustments.
Dee and Mac each encountered 192 minutes of downtime, largely stemming from batch coding errors and operational interruptions.
High downtime minutes among specific operators indicate areas where targeted training or support could reduce delays.


### Primary Downtime Factors:

Machine Adjustments accounted for the highest downtime, totaling 332 minutes.
Machine Failures resulted in 254 minutes of delay, suggesting a need for maintenance improvements.
Inventory Shortages contributed to 225 minutes of downtime, showing that stock management issues also impact productivity.

### Patterns in Operator-Specific Errors:

Operators appear to struggle with specific downtime causes:
Machine adjustments disproportionately impact Charlie, potentially indicating a lack of training or need for streamlined procedures.
Batch coding errors and other interruptions are recurring issues for Dee and Mac, hinting at potential gaps in error management training.

 ## RECOMMENDATIONS
### 1.	Enhance Predictive Maintenance:
Implement a predictive maintenance schedule to proactively address machine adjustments and failures. Leveraging this approach can help reduce the 586 minutes currently lost to machine-related issues. And also
Introduction of  sensors or software alerts that signal potential malfunctions, will facilitate timely interventions before failures occur.
### 2. 	Optimize Inventory Management:
Improve inventory tracking and replenishment processes to reduce the 225 minutes lost due to shortages. 
Adopting an inventory monitoring system could help ensure critical supplies are available when needed, preventing workflow interruptions. in addition there is need to 
Collaborate with supply chain management to forecast demand better and maintain optimal stock levels for continuous production flow.
### 3.	Targeted Operator Training:
Conduct specialized training sessions focused on troubleshooting machine adjustments and coding errors.
By building operators' skills in these specific areas, especially Charlie, Dee, and Mac, downtime could be significantly reduced. there is need to 
establish a quick-reference guide or visual aids near machinery to assist operators with common adjustments and error resolutions.
### 4.	Set Clear Efficiency Targets and Track Progress:
Establish a goal of 80% line efficiency and measure incremental progress towards this target. 
Tracking efficiency improvements will not only motivate the team but also provide insight into the effectiveness of implemented changes. And also there is need
Encourage operators to monitor and improve their performance metrics, fostering accountability and helping identify additional support needs.
### 5.	Regular Review of Downtime Data:

Continuously monitor and analyze downtime by cause and operator and use this data to refine training programs, adjust maintenance schedules, and optimize processes based on real-time feedback.
